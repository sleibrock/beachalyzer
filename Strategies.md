# Upgrade Strategies

There's no single upgrade path you can possibly take that would make 
you invincible to every attack in Boom Beach. If that were so, the game 
would be a lot harder. Whenever you start upgrading, you might realize you 
left a lot of holes open in your defense, so let's look at 
common attacks and what you can do to help your cause.

# All-In Riflemen

This is an attack consisting of all landing crafts using Riflemen. This is 
usually considered an All-In because the player doesn't care about the 
amount of Riflemen left after the attack, so they dump everything into 
Riflemen and go right for the throat. Sometimes this can be used in 
conjunction with Smokescreen.

The best counters to Riflemen would be *machine gun*, *mortar*, and 
*flamethrower*. If you get attacked by a lot of Riflemen, these towers 
make it a lot harder to get by. If you have *rocket launchers* or 
*shock launchers*, upgrade those as well, since those cause a lot more harass 
from longer ranges.

# Heavy Zooka / Smokey Hooka

The Hooka approach is a combination of tanky frontliners with high-DPS 
units to go straight for the headquarters. This one more or less depends 
on your base positioning, but you need strong *mortars*, *shock launchers*, 
*cannons*, and *snipers* to be able to deal with a general Hooka approach. 
Heavies have to at all times be in front of the Zookas, but if they get 
caught out of position enough, the towers should be able to remove 
low health Zookas.

# Tanks / Tanks Medics

Tanks / Medics is a slow DPS but high survivability approach. With medics, they 
can ignore damage from about 60% of towers, making machine guns, flamethrowers, 
mortars and rocket launchers partially useless in Tank defense.

The best defense is to upgrade your *cannons*, *boom cannons*, *boom mines*, 
*shock launchers*, *shock mines*, and if you have a weapons lab, consider using 
the *shock blaster*. Boom/cannons need to be able to rip Tanks quickly so that 
medics are unable to heal them, and when players lose 3-4 Tanks, the 
attack usually fails due to the low DPS and inability to take more towers.

# Scorchers / Anything

Scorchers are a high-health medium-DPS unit that can take _several_ boom cannon 
shots to defeat. Starting at 25,000 health, that's about 10 boom cannon shots 
to remove, if boom cannons can even live that long.

The key to defeating scorchers is control; namely the *shock launchers*. 
These will most likely be barraged by a scorcher user since Scorchers are 
slow units that need to get up close to do DPS. Upgrade your *boom cannons* to 
assist in defeating Scorchers, and upgrade *cannons* since they also have 
strong single-target DPS.

Scorchers are gunboat intensive (requiring 12 per craft), so if someone is 
using them, expect maybe only one or two in any given attack.

# Riflemen / Medics / Zooka

This is a hybrid strategy involving Riflemen as a replacement for Heavies, 
Zookas for long-range DPS, and Medics to repair Riflemen inbetween tower 
attacks. It's very popular now as Riflemen are very tanky in groups and 
medics can out-heal Rocket Launchers to an extent.

The best way to deal with this is through long-range control and short-range 
spread damage. *Mortars*, *machine guns*, *shock launchers*, *rocket launchers*, 
*flame throwers*, and if you have a weapons lab, a *lazer beam* is a good 
option to hit lots of units in a singular line.

# Smokescreen Warriors

This is a cheap but efficient strategy you'll see often. This one is based on 
getting Warriors to the HQ as fast as possible so you can use shock to disable 
nearby Warrior killers. Ideally the Warriors should be able to kill the HQ 
before the shock times run up and all their Warriors get slaughtered.

For this one you need Warrior killers, namely the *machine gun* and *flame thrower*. 
These are the highest DPS towers for close-range units, and the closer a 
Warrior is to a Machine Gun, they will take _MORE_ damage. *Mortars* are also 
good since most players don't ever aim to disable mortars, they are more or less 
a side-effect of shocking crucial warrior-killer buildings.

Change your layout so that your HQ is more defended by close-range machine guns, 
and surround your HQ with not-adjacent mines so you can burst the group of 
warriors entering close proximity. The player might have to burn a medkit 
if they get too low, making them lose more energy.

If you have a *shock launcher*, make sure it's not next to any crucial towers, 
as that is the number one priority for any Warrior player to disable.

# Grenadiers

This is more of a placement issue. Grenadiers have the longest range, making 
them hard to deal with. They are good for clumped up HQs with little spread, 
and good against bases with no front-line long-range harass. You need 
*boom cannons* to hit them from far away, and *snipers* to help alleviate the 
range battle.

*Shock launchers* help but often the grenadiers will work around the 
shock range or even kill it altogether. Improving it's building health
might help it survive a barrage.

The best option is to make your base defense attack on the beach instead 
of tucking it away in corners, because corners is where grenadiers 
thrive the most.


# Heavies / Bombardiers

One of the newest troops, the Bombardier, provides extreme long-range firepower.
However, they need a lot of protection because of how fragile they are. They
can outrange most buildings in the game, but cannot be left alone.

The best setup would be Heavies. Bombardiers cost gunboat energy to deploy, 
making it not ideal to use troops that also use energy (tanks, scorchers) 
unless you also boosted for gunboat energy. Heavies synergize well here because of 
the her Doctor Kavan, and his ability to respawn troops.

Deploy heavies, then deploy bombardiers, and when heavies go down, use Doctor Kavan 
to bring heavies (and also bombardiers) back so you can keep pushing. Because of Kavan, 
heavies are easier and cheaper to use and act like riflemen tanks in a sense. Singular 
boom cannons wouldn't be enough to stop this, and a great deal of prototypes are needed 
to stop this kind of attack.

This combination is currently one of the most powerful player attacking setups in the game.
